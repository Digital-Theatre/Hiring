# Opportunity for two developers to join Digital Theatre+

## Who are we?

Founded in 2009, Digital Theatre+ is the world’s leading arts education resource, already used by over 3 million students in
over 2000 schools, colleges and universities in 85 countries around the world. 

Our team is made up of a range of experts with high level professional experience in theatre, education and technology.

All of our work is created in-house in association with some of the UK's leading theatre practitioners, film makers and academics.

Our aim is to offer a vibrant, relevant and inspiring theatre arts experience that enriches, entertains and educates teachers and students all over the world.

## Our technology team

Responsible for building and operating Digital Theatre+ our team currently comprises three developers with a range of front-end, middleware and backend skills.  The team is supported by the Director of Technology.

## Who are we looking for?

We're looking for two developers to form the core of a team that will help us build the next generation of products for Digital Theatre+.   

We need to find people with a mix of front-end, back-end and platform experience who are positive, self-directed and keen to learn.  We like people with a passion for developing fast, secure, well designed, highly usable and accessible products.  

This is an opportunity to 'get in on the ground floor' of something new, that will help teachers and students around the world with their learning.  We're growing fast and our energetic, pro-active and positive Sales Team more doubled in size over the past 12 months, including opening of offices in Manchester and Chicago.

We've identified what we need to build, and are currently engaged with a product design agency to wireframe and design the product, so we are already starting to build it.  

Our current technology stack is a tightly-coupled Drupal 7 CMS and website, which lacks the flexibility we need.

## What's involved?

Some of the things we've already decided are: 

1. Blazingly fast Responsive Website with excellent accessibility
1. TypeScript
1. React + Next.js on Lambda for SSR
1. Tailwind
1. AWS IAM, Lamba (using Serverless framework), Cognito, Cloudwatch
1. GitHub - using Actions for CI/CD
1. VSCode
1. Open source
1. Apple MacBook Pro
1. Google Analytics and Data Studio
1. GraphQL Headless CMS
1. AWS Media Services for AWS Media Services for video transcoding, distribution and playback
1. Pairing and learning as the primary way of working

You'll be reporting directly into the Director of Technology, who will support and help you with whatever you need, whether it's hands on, decision making or direction.

## Not sure if you should apply?

We recognise that the web development field is massive and always evolving, that job descriptions often feel like they are asking too much of any one person; that terms such as front-end, back-end and platform are non-specific and cavernous.  

If you feel that you would contribute to our business, love getting hands on with technology, know good code from bad, and are keen to learn, please get in touch.
