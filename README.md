# Opportunity for two web developers to join Digital Theatre+

## Who are we?

We're the organisation that delivered a a 35% improvement in exam grades and 36% increase in student employability within the arts industry as a result of our product and content.

Our team is made up of a range of experts with high level professional experience in theatre, education and technology.

All of our work is created in-house in association with some of the UK's leading theatre practitioners, film makers and academics.

Our aim is to offer a vibrant, relevant and inspiring theatre arts experience that enriches, entertains and educates teachers and students all over the world.

## Who are we looking for?

We're looking for two web developers to form the core of a team that will help us build the next generation of products for Digital Theatre+.   

We need to find people with a mix of front-end, back-end and platform experience who are positive, self-directed and keen to learn.  We need people with a passion for developing fast, secure, well designed, highly usable and accessible products.  

This is an opportunity to 'get in on the ground floor' of something new, that will help teachers and students around the world with their learning.  We're growing fast and our energetic, pro-active and positive Sales Team more doubled in size over the past 12 months, including opening of offices in Manchester and Chicago.

We've identified what we need to build, and are currently engaging an agency to design the product, so we need to get ready to build it.  Our current technology stack is a tightly-coupled Drupal 7 CMS and website, which lacks the flexibility we need.

## What's involved?

Some of the things we've already decided are: 

1. AWS
2. GitHub - using actions for CI/CD
3. Serverless framework
4. TypeScript/JavaScript
5. UI Components
6. VSCode
7. Open source
8. Apple MacBook Pro

Beyond this we want you to be part of the decision making about how and what we use to deliver the new website.

Things we're leaning towards:

1. Cognito for user authentication

Still to be decided:

1. Our data model
2. Whether we continue to use our current Drupal CMS or move to something else
3. Our coding standards
4. Our development process and how we test
5. Whether to make an SPA
6. GraphQL / Rest / Both
7. Should we use AWS Amplify

And dozens of other decisions, both big and small.

You'll be reporting directly into the Director of Technology, who will support and help you with whatever you need, whether it's hands on, decision making or direction.

## Not sure if you should apply?

We recognise that the web development field is massive and always evolving, that job descriptions often feel like they are asking too much of any one person; that terms such as front-end, back-end and platform are non-specific and cavernous.  

If you feel that you would contribute to our business, love getting hands on with technology, know good code from bad, and are keen to learn, please get in touch.
